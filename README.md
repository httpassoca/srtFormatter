# python srt files string remover

I made this to remove specific strings and repeated substitles from multiple .srt files at once.

## How to use
- Have Python installed
- Put the .srt files to fix in the **input** folder
- Put desired strings to be removed on the blacklist_strings file.
- Run the python script:

```shell
python main.py
```

The new .srt files fixed will appear in the **output** folder
